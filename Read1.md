# Mastering markdown:
Markdown is a lightweight and user-friendly syntax to style all types of GitHub writing.
It's a way to web text format. The appearance of this text is managed by yourself. Formats words bold or italics, photos inserted and lists development are just some of the stuff that Markdown can do. Markdown is typically just a standard text that includes a few non-alphabetic characters, such as #or *.
